# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
I've been working with AWS on my own for about a year, and already have an account set up that I used during my certifications. I have a few IAM users set up, so I didn't set up another one for this bootcamp (I like to keep resources as low as possible). My IAM user has MFA set up using Authy.

I spent the most time with lucid.app designing the architecture diagram, which can be seen in the readme of the GitHub repo. I typically use draw.io, but lucid.app is smoother in my opinion. I have a basic application running in my account currently, and created a new budget for $50/mo with an alarm/email notification that gets sent at 50% of the threshold.
